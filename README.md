# Advanced Control Panel (v4.2) — Universal Roblox Client Script

A universal client-side control panel for Roblox executors. It builds an animated dark UI with movement tools, ESP, aimbot, utility actions, config import/export, and optional Discord webhook logging.

## Quick Start
1) Put `myscript.lua` in your repo and copy its raw URL (e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/main/myscript.lua`).
2) In your executor, load:
   ```lua
   loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/main/myscript.lua"))()
